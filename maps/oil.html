<h1>Oil Production 2011</h1>
<div class="map-desc">
<p>A map of the top 20 oil producing countries of 2011.  I imported data from the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/">U.S. Energy Information Administration</a> into <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> and used modified patterns from <a href="http://subtlepatterns.com/">Subtle Patterns</a> for background styling.  Point data is displayed with custom SVG markers that are scaled based on the amount of oil produced.  The markers also scale based on zoom level.  Hovering over or clicking a marker will open an info window with details about that country's output.  The map was uploaded to <a href="https://mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> for hosting.</p>
