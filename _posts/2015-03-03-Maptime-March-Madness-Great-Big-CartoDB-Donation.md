All of us at Maptime are excited to announce our first ever pretty darn big donation. Thanks to the fine folks at [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com), Maptimes that meet up in the month of March will get free pizza for up to 35 people.

This is huge! Maptime is self-organized by volunteers. Those without sponsorship have to shoulder the cost of snacks, Meetup.com fees, and sometimes even the cost for space. It's a testament to the commitment of our community…but it still adds up. This pizza donation will make it that much easier on our organizers this month.

For which we say…

###OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH, CARTODB!

Also many thanks to all of our organizers. It's your work that makes Maptime the amazing community that it is today.
